# House-Price-PREDICTION-SYSTEM

MACHINE LEARNING END TO END PROJECT:

PROBLEM:
BOSS OF STATE AGENT TELL HARRY:
•	The prediction of house price are set by team based on previous prices.
•	If the prediction of houses are not accurate then the company will be bank corrupt.
Harry says that:
•	Don’t worry we will build a model based on previous data
Boss replied that:
•	We have records of previous houses (their features as well as the prices).

SIGNIFICANCE:
•	We are given with the dataset of houses prices with some features like no of rooms ,bathroom etc.
•	Now we have to predict the price of the house by looking at the features.

WHAT SHOULD A PERSON ASKED THE OWNER?
1-The first question Harry should asked that what the business objective is and end goal.
2-Boss tell harry that whatever area is undervalued and your model is accurate and predicting the values of house will be higher for future we will buy that.
3-harry again asked the boss that what method you are already following in order to full fill this prediction
4-The boss answered that there are some expert in the industry who has domain knowledge, with the help of those we are predicting the house values. But the problem is that there 25% error so we are in loss.
Now we have the problem we have to build the model which best technique should we use?
•	ML algorithm like 
	Supervised
	Unsupervised
	Reinforcement
•	Classification or regression
•	Batch learning or online learning

	Since it is a supervised learning because we have features and labels.
	Since it is a regression task.
	Batch learning is when you have bundle of data. Whereas online learning is data is changing drastically so we have to train model continuously with the online data.

Selecting the performance measure?

•	Since it is a regression task so we prefer RMSE.
•	  since it is square 
•	Other performance measure are Manhattan ,mean absolute error. 

CHECKING THE ASSUMPTION?
•	On what assumption they are building the model. Here assumption means that boss objective. Harry needs to check the assumption again and again to make sure that harry is building the right model.

WHICH IDE YOU ARE USING?
•	COLAB 
•	.py file  will be useful when the complete model is build since in beginning we need to analyse data so we use colab.

KNOWING THE ATTRIBUTE VALUES
We should search about attributes value
